# Responsive-Level-1-Project-1
For this project, I created a one-page website for a produce store called Fruitflix. The layout strictly follows the provided wireframe, ensuring a clean and organized structure. The website features engaging visual elements such as graphics, designed to create an appealing and easy-to-navigate experience. The focus of the design is on clarity, user engagement, and a visually cohesive presentation of content.
